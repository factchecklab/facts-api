# Maat Response API Server

## Getting Started

1. Copy .env from .env.sample
2. Run yarn install
2. Run yarn migrate
3. Run yarn start

Or you can use `docker-compose up`. The API is available on port 4000.

Currently, the server creates database schema upon server starts. But it is
recommended that you run database schema migration.

To seed data, run `yarn seed:demo`.
